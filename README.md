I wanted to share with you my latest project, which is also my first HTML/CSS project. 
I have created a business card that features a small description of myself and provides links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. 
Additionally, visitors can download a copy of my resume directly from the card.
As someone who is just starting out in the web development field, I am excited to showcase my skills and provide a snapshot of my professional experience and abilities. 
I believe that this project is a great starting point for me to showcase my work and to get feedback from others in the industry.
